CMake
=====

.. warning::

    The CMake scripts do not have feature parity with the SCons ones at this
    stage and are still a work in progress. There are a number of people who
    have been working on alternative CMake solutions that are frequently
    referenced in the discord chats: Ivan's cmake-rewrite_ branch and
    Vorlac's godot-roguelite_ Project

.. _cmake-rewrite: https://github.com/IvanInventor/godot-cpp/tree/cmake-rewrite
.. _godot-roguelite: https://github.com/vorlac/godot-roguelite

Introduction
------------

Compiling godot-cpp independently of an extension project is mainly for
godot-cpp developers, package maintainers, and CI/CD. Look to the
godot-cpp-template_ for a practical example on how to consume the godot-cpp
library as part of a Godot extension.

Configuration examples are listed at the bottom of the page.

.. _godot-cpp-template: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp-template

SCons Deviations
----------------

Not everything from SCons can be perfectly representable in CMake, here are
the notable differences.

- debug_symbols
    No longer has an explicit option, and is enabled via Debug-like CMake
    build configurations; Debug, RelWithDebInfo.

- dev_build
    Does not define NDEBUG when disabled, NDEBUG is set via Release-like
    CMake build configurations; Release, MinSizeRel.

Testing Integration
-------------------
When consuming a third party CMake project into yours, an unfortunate side
effect is that the targets of the consumed project appear in the list of
available targets, and are by default included in the ALL meta target
created by most build systems. For this reason, all the targets specified
in godot-cpp are marked with the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` tag to prevent
unnecessary compilation. The testing targets ``godot-cpp.test.<target>``
are also guarded by ``GODOT_ENABLE_TESTING`` which is off by default.

To configure and build the godot-cpp project to enable the integration
testing targets the command will look something like:

.. code-block::

    # Assuming our current directory is the godot-cpp source root
    mkdir cmake-build
    cd cmake-build
    cmake .. -DGODOT_ENABLE_TESTING=YES
    cmake --build . --target godot-cpp.test.template_debug

Basic walkthrough
-----------------

.. topic:: Clone the git repository

    .. code-block::

        git clone https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp.git
        Cloning into 'godot-cpp'...
        ...
        cd godot-cpp


.. topic:: Out-of-tree build directory

    Create a build directory for CMake to put caches and build artifacts in and
    change directory to it. This is typically as a sub-directory of the project
    root but can be outside the source tree. This is so that generated files do
    not clutter up the source tree.

    .. code-block::

        mkdir cmake-build
        cd cmake-build

.. topic:: Configure the build

    CMake doesn't build the code, it generates the files that another tool uses
    to build the code. To see the list of generators run ``cmake --help``. The
    first phase of which is running through the configuration scripts.

    Configure and generate Ninja build files.

    .. code-block::

        cmake .. -G "Ninja"

    To list the available options CMake use the ``-L[AH]`` option. ``A`` is for
    advanced, and ``H`` is for help strings.

    .. code-block::

        cmake .. -LH

    Options are specified on the command line when configuring

    .. code-block::

        cmake .. -DGODOT_USE_HOT_RELOAD:BOOL=ON \
            -DGODOT_PRECISION:STRING=double \
            -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug

    Review setting-build-variables_ and build-configurations_ for more information.

    .. _setting-build-variables: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/user-interaction/index.html#setting-build-variables
    .. _build-configurations: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#build-configurations

    A non-exhaustive list of options:

    .. code-block::

        // Path to a custom GDExtension API JSON file (takes precedence over `GODOT_GDEXTENSION_DIR`) ( /path/to/custom_api_file )
        `GODOT_CUSTOM_API_FILE:FILEPATH=`

        // Force disabling exception handling code (ON|OFF)
        GODOT_DISABLE_EXCEPTIONS:BOOL=ON

        // Path to a custom directory containing GDExtension interface header and API JSON file ( /path/to/gdextension_dir )
        GODOT_GDEXTENSION_DIR:PATH=gdextension

        // Generate a template version of the Node class's get_node. (ON|OFF)
        GODOT_GENERATE_TEMPLATE_GET_NODE:BOOL=ON

        // Set the floating-point precision level (single|double)
        GODOT_PRECISION:STRING=single

        // Symbols visibility on GNU platforms. Use 'auto' to apply the default value. (auto|visible|hidden)
        GODOT_SYMBOL_VISIBILITY:STRING=hidden

        // Expose headers as SYSTEM.
        GODOT_SYSTEM_HEADERS:BOOL=ON

        // Enable the extra accounting required to support hot reload. (ON|OFF)
        GODOT_USE_HOT_RELOAD:BOOL=

        // Treat warnings as errors
        GODOT_WARNING_AS_ERROR:BOOL=OFF


.. topic:: Compiling

   A target and a configuration is required, as the default ``all`` target does
   not include anything and when using multi-config generators like ``Ninja
   Multi-Config``, ``Visual Studio *`` or ``Xcode`` the build configuration
   needs to be specified at build time. Build in Release mode unless you need
   debug symbols.

    .. code-block::

        cmake --build . -t template_debug --config Debug

Examples
--------

Windows and MSVC - Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So long as CMake is installed from the `CMake Downloads`_ page and in the PATH,
and Microsoft Visual Studio is installed with c++ support, CMake will detect
the MSVC compiler.

Remembering that Visual Studio is a Multi-Config Generator so the build type
needs to be specified at build time.

.. _CMake downloads: https://cmake.org/download/

.. code-block::

    # Assuming our current directory is the godot-cpp source root
    mkdir build-msvc
    cd build-msvc
    cmake .. -DGODOT_ENABLE_TESTING=YES
    cmake --build . -t godot-cpp.test.template_debug --config Debug


MSys2/clang64, "Ninja" - Debug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assumes the ming-w64-clang-x86_64-toolchain is installed

Remembering that Ninja is a Single-Config Generator so the build type
needs to be specified at Configure time.

Using the msys2/clang64 shell

.. code-block::

    # Assuming our current directory is the godot-cpp source root
    mkdir build-clang
    cd build-clang
    cmake .. -G"Ninja" -DGODOT_ENABLE_TESTING=YES -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    cmake --build . -t godot-cpp.test.template_debug

MSys2/clang64, "Ninja Multi-Config" - dev_build, Debug Symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assumes the ming-w64-clang-x86_64-toolchain is installed

This time we are choosing the 'Ninja Multi-Config' generator, so the build
type is specified at build time.

Using the msys2/clang64 shell

.. code-block::

    # Assuming our current directory is the godot-cpp source root
    mkdir build-clang
    cd build-clang
    cmake .. -G"Ninja Multi-Config" -DGODOT_ENABLE_TESTING=YES -DGODOT_DEV_BUILD:BOOL=ON
    cmake --build . -t godot-cpp.test.template_debug --config Debug

Emscripten for web platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I've only tested this on windows so far.

I cloned and installed the latest Emscripten tools to ``c:\emsdk``
At the time of writing that was v3.1.69

I've been using ``C:\emsdk\emsdk.ps1 activate latest`` to enable the
environment from powershell in the current shell.

The ``emcmake.bat`` utility adds the emscripten toolchain to the CMake command

.. code-block::

    # Assuming our current directory is the godot-cpp source root
    C:\emsdk\emsdk.ps1 activate latest
    mkdir build-wasm32
    cd build-wasm32
    emcmake.bat cmake ../
    cmake --build . --target template_release

Android Cross Compile from Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two separate paths you can choose when configuring for android.

Use the ``CMAKE_ANDROID_*`` variables specified on the commandline or in your
own toolchain file as listed in the cmake-toolchains_ documentation

.. _cmake-toolchains: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html#cross-compiling-for-android-with-the-ndk

Or use the toolchain and scripts provided by the Android SDK and make changes
using the ``ANDROID_*`` variables listed there. Where ``<version>`` is whatever
ndk version you have installed (tested with `23.2.8568313`) and ``<platform>``
is for android sdk platform, (tested with ``android-29``)

.. warning::

    The Android SDK website explicitly states that they do not support using
    the CMake built-in method, and recommends you stick with their toolchain
    files.

.. topic:: Using your own toolchain file as described in the CMake documentation

    .. code-block::

        # Assuming our current directory is the godot-cpp source root
        mkdir build-android
        cd build-android
        cmake .. --toolchain my_toolchain.cmake
        cmake --build . -t template_release

    Doing the equivalent on just using the command line

    .. code-block::

        # Assuming our current directory is the godot-cpp source root
        mkdir build-android
        cd build-android
        cmake .. \
            -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Android \
            -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=<platform> \
            -DCMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI=<arch> \
            -DCMAKE_ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/android-ndk
        cmake --build . -t template_release

.. topic:: Using the toolchain file from the Android SDK

    Defaults to minimum supported version( android-16 in my case) and armv7-a.

    .. code-block::

        # Assuming our current directory is the godot-cpp source root
        mkdir build-android
        cd build-android
        cmake .. --toolchain $ANDROID_HOME/ndk/<version>/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake
        cmake --build . -t template_release

    Specify Android platform and ABI

    .. code-block::

        # Assuming our current directory is the godot-cpp source root
        mkdir build-android
        cd build-android
        cmake .. --toolchain $ANDROID_HOME/ndk/<version>/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
            -DANDROID_PLATFORM:STRING=android-29 \
            -DANDROID_ABI:STRING=armeabi-v7a
        cmake --build . -t template_release


Toolchains
----------
This section attempts to list the host and target combinations that have been
at tested.

Info on cross compiling triplets indicates that the naming is a little more
freeform that expected, and tailored to its use case. Triplets tend to have the
format ``<arch>[sub][-vendor][-OS][-env]``
