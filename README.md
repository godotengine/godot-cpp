This repository contains the  *C++ bindings* for the [**Godot Engine**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)'s GDExtensions API.

## Versioning

This repositories follows the same branch versioning as the main [Godot Engine
repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot):

- `master` tracks the current GDExtension development branch for the next Godot
  4.x minor release.
- `3.x` tracks the development of the GDNative plugin for the next 3.x minor
  release.
- Other versioned branches (e.g. `4.0`, `3.5`) track the latest stable release
  in the corresponding branch.

Stable releases are also tagged on this repository:
[**Tags**](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp/tags).

**For any project built against a stable release of Godot, we recommend using
this repository as a Git submodule, checking out the specific tag matching your
Godot version.**

> As the `master` branch of Godot is constantly getting updated, if you are
> using `godot-cpp` against a more current version of Godot, see the instructions
> in the `gdextension` folder to update the relevant files.

## Compatibility

GDExtensions targeting an earlier version of Godot should work in later minor versions,
but not vice-versa. For example, a GDExtension targeting Godot 4.2 should work just fine
in Godot 4.3, but one targeting Godot 4.3 won't work in Godot 4.2.

There is one exception to this: extensions targeting Godot 4.0 will _not_ work with
Godot 4.1 and later.
See [Updating your GDExtension for 4.1](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.1.html#updating-your-gdextension-for-godot-4-1).

## Contributing

We greatly appreciate help in maintaining and extending this project. If you
wish to help out, please visit the [godot-cpp section of the Contributing docs](https://contributing.godotengine.org/en/latest/other/godot-cpp.html).

## Getting started

You need the same C++ pre-requisites installed that are required for the `godot` repository. Follow the [official build instructions for your target platform](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/engine_details/development/compiling/index.html).

Getting started with GDExtensions is a bit similar to what it was for 3.x but also a bit different.

This new approach is much more akin to how core Godot modules are structured.

Compiling this repository generates a static library to be linked with your shared lib,
just like before.

To use the shared lib in your Godot project you'll need a `.gdextension`
file, which replaces what was the `.gdnlib` before.
See [example.gdextension](test/project/example.gdextension) used in the test project:

```ini
[configuration]

entry_symbol = "example_library_init"
compatibility_minimum = "4.1"

[libraries]

macos.debug = "res://bin/libgdexample.macos.debug.framework"
macos.release = "res://bin/libgdexample.macos.release.framework"
windows.debug.x86_64 = "res://bin/libgdexample.windows.debug.x86_64.dll"
windows.release.x86_64 = "res://bin/libgdexample.windows.release.x86_64.dll"
linux.debug.x86_64 = "res://bin/libgdexample.linux.debug.x86_64.so"
linux.release.x86_64 = "res://bin/libgdexample.linux.release.x86_64.so"
# Repeat for other architectures to support arm64, rv64, etc.
```

The `entry_symbol` is the name of the function that initializes
your library. It should be similar to following layout:

```cpp
extern "C" {

// Initialization.

GDExtensionBool GDE_EXPORT example_library_init(GDExtensionInterfaceGetProcAddress p_get_proc_address, GDExtensionClassLibraryPtr p_library, GDExtensionInitialization *r_initialization) {
	godot::GDExtensionBinding::InitObject init_obj(p_get_proc_address, p_library, r_initialization);

	init_obj.register_initializer(initialize_example_module);
	init_obj.register_terminator(uninitialize_example_module);
	init_obj.set_minimum_library_initialization_level(MODULE_INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_SCENE);

	return init_obj.init();
}
}
```

The `initialize_example_module()` should register the classes in ClassDB, very like a Godot module would do.

```cpp
using namespace godot;
void initialize_example_module(ModuleInitializationLevel p_level) {
	if (p_level != MODULE_INITIALIZATION_LEVEL_SCENE) {
		return;
	}
	GDREGISTER_CLASS(Example);
}
```

Any node and resource you register will be available in the corresponding `Create...` dialog. Any class will be available to scripting as well.

## Examples and templates

See the [godot-cpp-template](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp-template) project for a
generic reusable template.

Or checkout the code for the [Summator example](https://github.com/paddy-exe/GDExtensionSummator)
as shown in the [official documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/scripting/cpp/gdextension_cpp_example.html).
